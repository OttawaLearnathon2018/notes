Avenues of investigation
- What is the relationship between reservations and visits? For HPG we only have reservation data
- Can reservations better predict visits?
- What is the relationship between the time people reserve and the time people show up? Is this relevant?
- Does reservation predict visits better, when the gap between reservation date and visit date is closer
- Size of group of reservation related to the likelihood that the reservation will show up, or there will be more visits.
